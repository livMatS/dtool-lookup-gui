Code style
----------
Always follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the exception of line
breaks.

Development branches
--------------------
New features should be developed always in its own branch. When creating your own branch,
please prefix that branch by the date of creation.
For example, if you begin working on implementing pagination on 6th April 2023, the branch could be called `2023-04-06-pagination`.
